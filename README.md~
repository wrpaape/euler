# Euler

## Purpose
> Euler is an ongoing exercise in exploring the implementation of data-structures and algorithms in a variety of programming languages and paradigms.
> Basically this repo serves to attempt to organize [the progress on my project euler account](https://projecteuler.net/progress=tastyham).

## Structure
> Wrapped in a commandline interface built with Elixir's Mix framework, Euler houses solutions to mathematical word problems hosted on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add euler to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:euler, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure euler is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:euler]]
        end
